# COVID-19 Regression Models

This is an asssignment for the artificial intelligence class at FEUP.

The goal was to apply the knowledge about machine learning and try to train various models to predict the COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths and recovered cases. 
 
We ended up training 3 models: **K-Nearest neighbor**, **Multilayer Perceptron** and a **Support Vector Machine**.
 
In the notebook we go into more detail about how we treated the datasets given to us and how we went into using the **Scikit-learn** library to train the models.
